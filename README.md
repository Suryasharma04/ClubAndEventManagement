# ClubAndEventManagement

This versatile software enables to manage events and organization within their institution. The program provides a centralized system accessible to different user roles, including regular members, E-Board members, and the Organizing Committee. 
Regular members are able to view available events, including details such as the hosting club, event name, location, time, and E-Board members associated with the club.
Club members(E-Board) have additional functionality, allowing them to create or remove events as needed. This flexibility allows them to manage and update their club's event schedule efficiently. 
The Organizing Committee serves as the administrative authority and ensures clubs meet predefined requirements. If a club fails to meet these standards, the Organizing Committee reserves the right to remove it from the system. The software should offer features for viewing, adding, and removing events, clubs, and members. A main directory serves as the centralized storage unit, housing all relevant information regarding members, clubs, and events.
This program is intended for users who want to manage a system for events, clubs, and members. 
Overall, the program aims to enhance event management and organization, providing users with the tools they need to efficiently coordinate and execute various activities within the institution.
(NOTE: In the future, I hope to integrate the verification of the clubs and members, budget requests, and budget approval from the organising committee.)
